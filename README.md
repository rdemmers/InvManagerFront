# Inventory Manager Front-end

This project is meant to be a front-end for my inventory manager back-end. Since Java is currently my focus this project is still quite a mess. At this point my priority for this project is that I can display the data of my Java project in an clear manner, so optimization and scaleablity aren't a focus right now.

For images of the application in action, please visit my 'invmanager' repository.
